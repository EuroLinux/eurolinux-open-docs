With the end of 2021, CentOS will end its life in its current form and will start functioning as CentOS Stream, a development branch for Red Hat\u00ae Enterprise Linux\u00ae. As a result, it will stop receiving proven, stable updates and its use, especially in production environments, will become risky. This is a very serious problem for many companies and individuals around the world. So there was an urgent need to find a new source of updates for CentOS in order to keep it in the infrastructure. A complete solution to this problem is support switching, that is, pointing to a new repository from which CentOS will be downloading stable updates. Such a solution is offered by EuroLinux. It is worth mentioning that both CentOS and RHEL and EuroLinux are systems built on the same source code, so they provide the same functionality. They differ mainly in branding. The operation of switching support is simple, reasonably safe and completely reversible. What is very important, it requires neither reinstallation of the system nor the applications installed on it. The process consists of switching the repository, installing the el-release package, updating the system and reinstalling the system packages in-place. After the in-place migration, CentOS will still be usable, even in production environments. All resources used in this tutorial can be found in the additional resources section . The solution A project named eurolinux-migration-scripts has been created. It contains among others a script that will take care of the migration automatically. Here we describe, how to perform the switch successfully. Preparations It's vital that the system be updated to the newest release. Use the following command: sudo yum update -y Running the migration script Then download the latest production-ready release of the project containing the script. Unpack the release, visit the unpacked directory and run the script - usually this will require right-clicking in the current directory, using the 'Open in Terminal' option and running this command: sudo bash migrate2eurolinux.sh Refer to the project's README for additional commands. After the switch Once the migration has finished, it's recommended to reboot your system: sudo reboot Once the system has rebooted, the migration process can be considered complete. In order to quickly verify that it was carried out successfully, we can check the distribution description: cat /etc/el-release As a result we should get a response about the distribution and latest EuroLinux version. Conclusion As you can see, the process is quick and seamless. You can switch the repository for RHEL, Oracle Linux, AlmaLinux, and Rocky Linux the same way. In each case, the process will look almost identical. If you have any questions or concerns, please submit them to the repository linked in the additional resources section . Thank you.

Introduction Use cases Consider the following examples: - You use software that doesn't work on your EuroLinux 8 installation. - You want to try out some potentially dangerous actions and don't want to endanger your machine. - You develop some awesome software and want to test it on several systems for compatibility - You want an easily reproducible environment that works the same way on every person's machine - You need a multi-machine laboratory, maybe with several different systems and don't have the resources for a physical equipment Why use it over other virtualisation providers? VirtualBox is the provider with a copyleft license and a focus on interoperability when it comes to supporting different platforms. This allows you to cooperate with someone running a different operating system and when exchanging documentation - once written it's applicable to anyone that can run the software. New VirtualBox versions usually support older operating systems too. One can enjoy the new features on a system, which has recently reached its End of Life, which can be indispensable for a company that can't migrate yet. System requirements A brief documentation is available at Upstream's . Your machine shall support hardware virtualisation. If it doesn't, you either need to perform additional troubleshooting - e.g. enable virtualisation in your machine's BIOS settings.

[ \"$(arch)\" == \"x86_64\" ] && echo \"OK\" Installation on EuroLinux 8 As of today (2 September 2021), 6.1 is the main VirtualBox branch and this is the one we install in this guide. Assuming your account has been made an administrator during the system installation process, simply run these commands for an installation: sudo dnf groupinstall \"Development Tools\" -y sudo dnf config-manager \\ --add-repo=https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/rpm/el/virtualbox.repo sudo dnf install VirtualBox-6.1 -y VirtualBox should be ready to use! USB devices If you want VirtualBox to support USB devices for your system account, run this command as well: sudo usermod -a -G vboxusers $USER then log out of your graphical session and log in again. Extension Pack VirtualBox doesn't support certain technologies out-of-the-box, e.g. USB 2.0/3.0 or builtin disk encryption, among others. If you want them to be supported, you will need VirtualBox Extension Pack. Make sure you have read its license and understand its implications - you're responsible for compliance. You may want to read Upstream's FAQ for a quick start. Once you're sure you'll be able to comply with the licensing terms, run these commands to install the Extension Pack: export vbox_version=\"$(VBoxManage --version | cut -d'r' -f 1)\" wget \"https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/$vbox_version/Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-$vbox_version.vbox-extpack\" yes | sudo VBoxManage extpack install --replace Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-$vbox_version.vbox-extpack Troubleshooting I can't enable hardware virtualisation and prefer software emulation As Upstream says , for software mode you'll need VirtualBox branch 6.0 or older.

System Requirements x86_64 (64 bit AMD/Intel architecture) Minimal and recommended requirements are following: Resource Absolute minimal requirements for cloud deployment Minimal Recommended Logical CPU 1 1 1 RAM 768MB or 512MB with swap space 1 GB 1.5 GB per logical CPU Storage 5 GB (excluding swap) 10GB 20GB Logical CPU means Physical CPU (including Hyper-Threading) or vCPU (virtual CPU). Warning It might be impossible to install EuroLinux on a system that does not meet recommended requirements. About absolute minimums for cloud deployment During our internal testing, we were able to boot and use very basic and already installed services on Virtual Machine with only 256 MB of RAM. However, without additional memory or at least swap space available, things like updating the system will result in actions of Kernel Out of Memory (OOM) Killer. You can try it yourself with EuroLinux Vagrant boxes and following Vagrantfile: Vagrant . configure ( \"2\" ) do | config | config . vm . box = \"eurolinux-vagrant/eurolinux-8\" # Explicitly disable vbguest because we are using rsync if Vagrant . has_plugin? ( \"vagrant-vbguest\" ) config . vbguest . auto_update = false end config . vm . provider \"virtualbox\" do | vb | vb . memory = \"256\" vb . cpus = 1 end config . vm . provider \"libvirt\" do | vb | vb . memory = \"256\" vb . cpus = 1 end end It's also possible to install EuroLinux on less than 5 GB of space, but it also requires extra attention. All absolute minimums for cloud deployments described above are not officially supported by EuroLinux. Secure boot At the moment, EuroLinux does not support secure boot. The full secure boot support is planned at the end of Q3/beginning of Q4. How to install EuroLinux 8 from ISO Where can you obtain ISO? We distribute EuroLinux in a responsible open core model. Because of that, you might download EuroLinux from different sources. The two primary sources are: https://fbi.cdn.euro-linux.com/isos/ open for everyone https://customerportal.euro-linux.com for EuroLinux customers The only difference is that Customer Portal keeps older versions, when CDN, that is used for mirroring, keeps only two of the latest ISOs for each version to save space (single EuroLinux AppStream ISO might take up to 10 GB). If you are running a huge deployment, you might consider setting up your own mirror and download ISOs from Intranet. How to check ISO integrity During download, many things can happen - from a network or sending host failure to single-bit error. To check if ISO is undamaged, there are two mechanisms in place. For each EuroLinux ISO there's a file with its checksums and appropriate digest algorithms. Its name says, which algorithm was used to calculate the cryptographic digest. For example, you can browse https://fbi.cdn.euro-linux.com/isos/ and read the sha1sums.txt file. When the ISO download is completed, you can invoke the sha1sum command on the ISO file and check if checksums match. [Alex@SpaceShipEL8 Downloads]$ sha1sum EL-8.3-x86_64-20210624-appstream.iso 6a8abaaebe288553ec8568bd9de3f5fda5f1ddb5 EL-8.3-x86_64-20210624-appstream.iso The second mechanism for checking ISO integrity is built-in inside the installer itself. When you start the installation, use the Test this media & install EuroLinux 8 entry: After booting up, the ISO checking process will start. Installation with GUI Because even a minimal installation uses a GUI the whole process is simple and straightforward. EuroLinux 8, as well as previous versions, uses Anaconda installer that clearly informs the user what needs to be done in order to install the system. First, you have to choose the language that will be used during installation: After configuring the installer language you should see a menu similar to: Anaconda installer LOCALIZATION section: Keyboard - this section allows you to setup keyboard layouts, including the default keyboard layout, additional layouts and key combination to switch between them. Language support - additional languages packages that should be installed. Time & Date - configure the date, time zone, enable NTP and NTP servers. Anaconda installer SOFTWARE section: Configuring source of the installation Here you might configure the source of your installation. By default, the system installs from the ISO image itself. This is one of the officially supported ways to install EuroLinux . If you enable a NIC (Network Interface Card) in the Network installer section, you might add additional EuroLinux repositories and/or other repositories. If you add EuroLinux repositories, the installer will automatically download newer version of the packages. EuroLinux 8 repositories: URL: https://fbi.cdn.euro-linux.com/dist/eurolinux/server/8/$basearch/certify-BaseOS/os Name: BaseOSProd URL: https://fbi.cdn.euro-linux.com/dist/eurolinux/server/8/$basearch/certify-AppStream/os Name: AppStreamProd URL: https://fbi.cdn.euro-linux.com/dist/eurolinux/server/8/$basearch/certify-PowerTools/os Name: PowerToolsProd For EuroLinux 8 beta: URL: https://fbi.cdn.euro-linux.com/dist/eurolinux/server/8/$basearch/certify-beta-BaseOS/os Name: BaseOSBeta URL: https://fbi.cdn.euro-linux.com/dist/eurolinux/server/8/$basearch/certify-beta-AppStream/os Name: AppStreamBeta URL: https://fbi.cdn.euro-linux.com/dist/eurolinux/server/8/$basearch/certify-beta-PowerTools/os Name: PowerToolsBeta Limited support. Hybrid network installation from both ISO and public repositories is not our primary goal in the QA process . Packages in EuroLinux repositories are regularly updated, and it might be impossible to install a system from an external source. Depending on the state of the upstream, we might not fix a potential issue. Below you can see an example configuration that was used to install a system: After changing the installation source, you will have to confirm Software Selection . Software Selection Software Selection allows you to customize which packages will be installed. You might choose from base environment groups like Server with GUI , Workstation or Minimal . You can also install additional package groups. Anaconda installer SYSTEM section: Installation selection allows choosing on which disk the system will be installed. If you want to have a fully encrypted system, you should enable encryption in this step. KDUMP allows choosing if KDUMP (Kernel crash dump collection mechanism) should be enabled. Network & Hostname - you can configure your system networking here Security policy - you can setup an additional openscap policy here Anaconda installer USER SETTINGS section: Root Password - by default, the root user is disabled. If a user is created in User Creation section, the root account can stay disabled User Creation section allows creating a regular user in the system. If the Make this user administrator option is checked, the root account can be disabled. After applying all the necessary changes , the installation can be started with the \"Begin Installation\" button. Disk partition recommended minimums You need at least the following partitions. /boot for Linux kernel and init ramdisks - 1GB / (root partition) - at least 10 GB (a very minimal system might use as little as 2GB - but it requires extra attention and is not officially supported by EuroLinux) For UEFI, an EFI system partition is also required. /boot/efi - at least 100MB If your storage allows it, the following partitions are also highly recommended: swap - 1GB or more depending on the system RAM and workload. Swap is also required for hibernation. Depending on the workload of the system, it should be at least as spacious as system RAM. /home - at least 1GB - but in most cases, if / can be as big as 80GB, then /home/ usually takes the rest of the free space Installing EuroLinux in basic graphic mode Suppose there is a problem loading/running your graphics card driver (it might results in a black screen/error message or graphical artifacts). It's possible to install EuroLinux in basic graphics mode. To do so, choose Troubleshooting on the welcome menu, and then Install EuroLinux 8 in basic graphics mode . From this point the process is identical to a standard installation with GUI. Installing EuroLinux in text mode To install EuroLinux in text mode: Boot EuroLinux ISO Press Esc to stop installation options selection timeout Press Tab Add inst.text to the end of the kernel boot command line Press Enter Before running the installation you have to provide all the necessary information (represented as ! in selection). It's a good idea to refresh the menu with R + Enter command shortly after the installer started. After customization you are ready to start your installation. Other possibilities EuroLinux can also be installed in the following manner: Automated installation with a kickstart file. Installation with PXE Installation via VNC Please consult upstream documentation about these topics. Using EuroLinux From this point, you can use EuroLinux as any other RHEL\u2122 based distribution. Submitting a Request for Change We truly care. If there is something that you believe could/should be changed/improved in the EuroLinux distribution and does not break compatibility with the upstream project, then drop us the issue on GitHub! All contributors are extremely welcome. EuroLinux Distro Bugs and RFC Submitting a Bug report We decided that submitting bug reports should not involve registration into some nasty miserable software. At the very same time, we know that most open-source developers have GitHub profiles. This choice makes the decision making and work as transparent as possible.

Installation on EuroLinux 8 Simply run these commands and you're ready to go: sudo dnf config-manager \\ --add-repo=https://rpm.releases.hashicorp.com/RHEL/hashicorp.repo sudo dnf install vagrant -y EuroLinux Boxes A box is a format that defines: an image of an operating system with preinstalled software, a provider for that image and its version - it's a ready-made appliance for that provider to run. This appliance works the same across people's workstations, which most likely will have differences in configuration and potentially different providers or even operating systems. That is as long as they use a provider, which the box is built for. EuroLinux Vagrant boxes are available at: https://app.vagrantup.com/eurolinux-vagrant Let's use the box eurolinux-vagrant/eurolinux-8 as an example. Box details See the details of the box - multiple providers, that the box has been built for, are listed along with the box versions and build dates. When writing your specification, you'll be able to choose from them as you wish. Run the box Here's a basic procedure for running a Vagrant environment (a virtual machine, which uses our box) in a separate directory: mkdir el8-vagrant cd el8-vagrant/ vagrant init eurolinux-vagrant/eurolinux-8 vagrant up vagrant ssh You should now be connected to the machine and able to perform your desired operations inside it. Go ahead, play around, install your favourite developer tools, build an awesome, advanced, multi-component application and be sure everyone's able to deploy it on their workstations without any hassle! What about the specification mentioned earlier? - Vagrantfile Once you've ran the commands above, you'll have a Vagrantfile in the el8-vagrant directory. Take a look, what's inside. You'll be greeted with an introduction, references and lots of common options along with comments explaining them: # The most common configuration options are documented and commented below. # For a complete reference, please see the online documentation at # https://docs.vagrantup.com. As you've already ran the box as explained in the previous section, you can see that there's no necessity to tweak anything inside Vagrantfile. The parameters that you can tweak, e.g. the virtual machine's memory or the amount of CPUs you should adapt to your work - e.g. if you need additional resources for developing/running your application, go ahead and increase them. Once that's done, check out if they can be reduced once you know your software resource requirements. Depending on the task you want to achieve, whether it be a ready-made appliance or a base virtual system that gets provisioned with your application and its dependencies or something else, that's when changes to the specification must be made - e.g. the additional provisioning procedure shall be written. As the comment quoted above says, refer to the comments the Vagrantfile provided for common options explanation. Once you know their purpose, try them out! Get comfortable with them and read Upstream's documentation for additional info, tips and more advanced, cool possibilities - such as a multi-machine infrastructure defined in a single Vagrantfile.

It was also the first version when we deployed our engineer to remote sites (in most cases virtual) to provide support for organisations that rebuild RHEL/EuroLinux from sources with Gaia build system. This version code name is Tirana - the capital city of Albania. Below you can find the essential changes in EuroLinux 8.5 release for x86_64 architecture. The aarch64 GA release is slightly delayed. Release notes for aarch64 will be provided in a separate document. Dynamic programming languages, Web and Database servers New versions of the following components are now available: Ruby 3.0 - module ruby stream 3.0. nginx 1.20 - module nginx stream 1.20 Nodejs 16 - module nodejs stream 16 Compiler Toolset The following compiler toolsets have been updated in EL 8.5: GCC Toolset 11 - software collection gcc-toolset-11 LLVM Toolset 12.0.1 - module llvm-toolset stream rhel Rust Toolset 1.54.0 - module rust-toolset stream rhel Go Toolset 1.16.7 - module go-toolset stream rhel Security Most of the security features are connected to rebased/updated versions of the packages. The most crucial security changes include: rsyslog - now support OpenSSL OpenSCAP framework - added new profiles and multiple changes and enhancements cryptopolicies were updated - these system-wide cryptographic policies from this version support different policies for different backends (scoped policies) High Availability and Resilient Storage cmirror was updated to version 2.03.12 corosync was updated to version 3.1.5 pacemaker was updated to version 2.1.0 resource-agents-paf package was added to HA an RS repositories General updates and improvements Among the others, the following packages were updated and enhanced: NetworkManager was updated to 1.32.10 from 1.30 OpenIMP was updated to 2.0.31 from 2.0.29 acel was updated to 3.1 from 2.8 bluez was updated to 5.56 from 5.52 chrony was updated to 4.1 from 3.5 cockpit was updated to version 251.1 from 238.2 crypto-policies was updated to 20210617 from 20210209 dnf was updated to 4.7.0 from 4.4.2 elfutils were updated to 0.185 from 0.182 freeipmi was updated to 1.6.8 from 1.6.6 gnutls was updated to 3.6.16 from 3.6.14 ibacm was updated to 35.0 from 32.0 libmodulemd updated to version 2.13.0 from 2.9.4 libreswan was updated to version 4.4 from 4.3 main GCC was updated to 8.5.0 from 8.4.1 opencryptoki updated to version 3.16.0 from 3.15.1 rsyslog was updated to version 8.2102.0 from 8.1911.0 sssd was updated to version 2.5.2 from 2.4.0 New packages Among the others, the following packages were added to this release: adwaita-qt5 ansible-collection-microsoft-sql ansible-collection-redhat-rhel_mgmt ansible-freeipa-tests ansible-pcp compact-hwloc1 coreos-installer dotnet-build-reference-packages dotnet-sdk-3.1-source-built-artifacts dotnet-sdk-5.0-source-built-artifacts dotnet5.0-build-reference-packages eth-tools flatpak (i686) included in PowerTools java-17-openjdk* libadwaita-qt5 libcap-ng-python3 libcomps-devel is now included in PowerTools libvoikko-devel - is now included in PowerTools lpsolve (i686) is now included in PowerTools mobile-broadband-provider-info-devel is now included in PowerTools modulemd-tools pcm python3-cloud-what python3-libstoragemgmt python3-pillow (i686) is now included in PowerTools python3-pyghmi qt5-qtserialbus-devel is now included in PowerTools resource-agents-paf (resilient storage) rsyslog-openssl samba-vfs-iouring sblim-gather sblim-gather-provider is now included in PowerTools sevctl stratisd-dracut tesseract tss2 udftools unicode-ucd-unihan xapian-core and its development packages are now included How to update from beta The beta repository has an updated package el-release , that contains production repositories. Upgrading from EuroLinux 8.5 beta to 8.5 is as simple as running: sudo yum update -y el-release sudo yum update -y Branded packages Multiple packages have names changed due to branding, including: redhat-backgrounds -> el-backgrounds redhat-indexhtml -> el-indexhtml redhat-logos -> el-logos redhat-logos-httpd -> el-logos-httpd redhat-logos-ipa -> el-logos-ipa redhat-release -> el-release redhat-release-eula -> el-release - we include EULA in release package All these packages have proper RPM provides declaration. The list of the packages that are changed due to branding includes, among the others: abrt anaconda anaconda-user-help anacondafirefox cloud-init crash httpd initial-setup ipa libreport libguestfs libreoffice nginx opa-ff opa-fm openscap osindo-db python3 redhat-rpm-config scap-security-guide skopeo sos subscription-manager thunderbird Batteries Batteries repository contains packages that are needed to rebuild the distribution but are not included in upstream repositories. Right now, this repository includes more than 2100 packages for each buildroot. Multiple batteries were updated for this release there including: Bootstraps for rust-toolset Bootstraps for go-toolset Gaia build system Gaia build system was updated in all interested parties' environments. We also changed the rebuild policy. None of our customers were interested in using RHEL as a buildroot for their own Enterprise Linux forks. It means that EuroLinux must be released faster, but at the very same time, we can exclusively focus on providing EuroLinux in the early stages and thus release it faster. We also decided that the next version will be released asynchronously with more batch compilation. Synchronization was especially problematic in this release as there was a lot of holidays in Poland. Other notable changes EuroLinux 8.5 is the first version that can use baseos-all , appstream-all and powertools-all , 'high-availability-all , resilient-storage-all repositories that contain all packages produced during build process. However, these packages are not supported by upstream or EuroLinux. They are intended for developers to build they own solutions. EuroLinux reverted the previous changes that made DockerHub the default container image registry. We observed other RHEL clones and decide that keeping default might be more suitable for users.
