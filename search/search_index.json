With the end of 2021, CentOS ended its life in its stable form and started functioning as CentOS Stream, a development branch for Red Hat\u00ae Enterprise Linux\u00ae. As a result, it stopped receiving proven, stable updates and its use, especially in production environments, became risky. This is a very serious problem for many companies and individuals around the world. So there was an urgent need to find a new source of updates for CentOS in order to keep it in the infrastructure. A complete solution to this problem is support switching, that is, pointing to a new repository from which CentOS will be downloading stable updates. Such a solution is offered by EuroLinux. It is worth mentioning that both CentOS and RHEL and EuroLinux are systems built on the same source code, so they provide the same functionality. They differ mainly in branding.</p> <p>The operation of switching support is simple, reasonably safe and completely reversible.  What is very important, it requires neither reinstallation of the system nor the applications installed on it. The process consists of switching the repository, installing the el-release package, updating the system and reinstalling the system packages in-place. After the in-place migration, CentOS will still be usable, even in production environments. </p> <p>All resources used in this tutorial can be found in the additional resources section.</p>"},{"location":"HowTo/centos8-eol-solution/#the-solution","title":"The solution","text":"<p>A project named eurolinux-migration-scripts has been created.
