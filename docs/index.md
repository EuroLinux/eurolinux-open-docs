# EuroLinux


## About Documentation
This is EuroLinux community-driven documentation.

**We welcome your contributions to EuroLinux!**

You can:

- star the repository to show your support
- contribute via a Pull Request - see [Contribution Guide](#contributors-guide)
- create requests for a particular topic via [Issue Creation on
  GitHub](https://github.com/EuroLinux/eurolinux-open-docs/issues/new/choose)



!!! info additional documentation
    As EuroLinux is in Open Core model there are also additional documentation
    for our customer that are available at [EuroLinux Support
    Portal](https://support.euro-linux.com).

## How documentation is organized?

Documentation is organized in the following manner:

- JumpStarts - Installation guides with extras
- HowTo - How To guides on various topics
- Erratas - EuroLinux erratas in the form of the web pages
- Release Notes

## How to contribute

We love your input! We value transparent and easy to contribute projects, that's
why we choose GitHub. You can contribute to this project with:

- Proposing a new topic that should be described
- Discussing the current state of the docs
- Reporting a bug
- Submitting a fix

**We Use GitHub with GitHub Flow. All changes are made through pull requests.**

Pull requests are the best and well-established way to propose changes. The
GitHub Flow that allows us to provide reviews and discussion about documentation/code
is described in detail [here](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html).

Use our specially crafted issue templates: [EuroLinux Open Docs issue from a
template](https://github.com/EuroLinux/eurolinux-open-docs/issues/new/choose) to
contribute a topic you would like to see.

If you want to contribute with code (we keep documentation as code), do the
following:

1. Fork the repository and create your own branch from master.
2. It would be great if you could test your changes with mkdocs (described in
   detail in [Setup environment locally](#setup-environment-locally))
3. Write/Apply your changes and commit to your branch.
4. Create a pull request!

### GitHub Labs

If you are new to Git VCS (Version Control System) or GitHub, you can visit
[GitHub Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/), especially [First Day on GitHub
course](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/first-day-on-github).  GitHub
courses are free, interactive and put stress on practical aspects.

## Tools
We are using `mkdocs` with `mkdocs-material` to build and style our
documentation.

- [MkDocs site](https://mkdocs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [Material for MkDocs site](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)


## Setup environment locally

Because MkDocs is Python based, you need at least these installed to run this
documentation locally:

- python3 (3.6+)
- pip
- virtualenv

First, let's create a virtualenv, so you don't bloat your system-wide python
environment:
```
virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 venv
```

Then activate virtualenv

Bash:
```bash
. venv/bin/activate
```

Fish:
```fish
. venv/bin/activate.fish
```

Now you are ready to install MkDocs and other Python packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After it serving documentation on your host is as easy as running:
```
mkdocs serve
```

To build documentation invoke:
```
mkdocs build
```

It will build documentation and save it into `site` directory

!!! warning "Please don't include site directory in pull requests"
    Because we deploy this documentation with GitHub Pages, the `site`
    directory is not gitignored


## Markdown cheat sheet for this project
We created simple cheat sheet for MkDocs markdown syntax with extensions
enabled in this project. It can be found
[here](HowTo/z-documentation-markdown.md).
