## Batteries

Batteries repository contains packages that are needed to rebuild the
distribution but are not included in any upstream repositories. Right now,
this repository includes more than 3000 packages for each buildroot.

About 150 packages were updated for x86_64 buildroot alone. We also added some
of the packages (like python3.11 for i686) to the publicly available **open
buildroots**.

## Known issues

- Due to compose error LibreOffice is available in the older version than one
  available in the RHEL 8.8 beta. The new version will land in main repos shortly.
