## Branded packages

- redhat-logos-httpd -> el-logos-httpd
- redhat-logos-ipa -> el-logos-ipa
- redhat-release -> el-release
- redhat-release-eula -> el-release - we include EULA in release package

All these packages have proper RPM `provides` declaration.

The list of the packages that are changed due to branding includes, among others:

- abrt
- anaconda
- anaconda-user-help
- cloud-init
- crash
- firefox
- httpd
- initial-setup
- ipa
- libguestfs
- libreoffice
- libreport
- nginx

- opa-fm
- openscap
- osinfo-db
- python3
- redhat-rpm-config
- scap-security-guide
- sos
- subscription-manager
- thunderbird

## Removed packages

The following packages were removed:

- rhc and related packages
- insights-client and related packages

## Batteries

Batteries repository contains packages that are needed to rebuild the
distribution but are not included in any upstream repositories. Right now,
this repository includes more than 3000 packages for each buildroot.

About 50 packages were updated for x86_64 buildroot alone. We also added some
of the packages (like python3.11 for i686) to the publicly available **open
buildroots**.

## Known issues

- The AppStream is is about 15GiB. After long discussion and feedback we
  decided to keep it RHEL like way, where AppStream ISO is so full because it
  can be used to mount repositories used for mirroring and system. We are
  sorry but current state (mostly modularity) make things extremely hard to
  manage without breaking user experience.
- There is huge problem with packages of java-21 not being reproducible.

## Gaia build system

We are currently using Gaia 3.0 and preparing 4.0 with branding kit.
