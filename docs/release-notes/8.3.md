### Identity Management

The Rivest Cipher 4 (RC4) cipher suite, the default encryption type for users,
services, and trusts between Active Directory domains in an Active Directory
forest, has been deprecated in EuroLinux 8. For compatibility, this
release introduces cryptographic subpolicy named *AD-SUPPORT* to enable
support for this deprecated encryption type. The new subpolicy allows you to
use RC4 with EuroLinux IPA and SSSD Active Directory. 

### The web console

The cockpit web console provides an option to switch between superuser
access and limited access from inside of a user session.

### Desktop and graphics

The **Direct Rendering Manager** (DRM) kernel graphics subsystem has been
rebased to upstream Linux kernel version 5.6. It provides a number of
enhancements over the previous versions, including support for new GPUs and
APUs.
