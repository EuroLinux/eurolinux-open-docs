# EuroLinux 8.6 Beta Release Notes

EuroLinux 8.6 is the first minor release with a full-fledged beta available
before the General Availability of the upstream version (RHEL 8.6). The Beta
version will allow releasing EuroLinux 8.6 GA faster. We decided to publish

version will release all supported arches simultaneously.

This versionâ€™s code name is Kyiv - the capital city of Ukraine.
