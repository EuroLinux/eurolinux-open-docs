# EuroLinux 9 Desktop

**EuroLinux Desktop is a novelty in the operating system market. It combines the look and functionality of Windows® and macOS® with the reliability and security of a server-based Enterprise Linux distribution.**

## Overview
EuroLinux Desktop is built upon the source code of Red Hat® Enterprise Linux® 9. However, it includes a number of changes to the user interface. These primarily concern the system's appearance and usability. GNOME extensions have been used for this purpose. In EuroLinux Desktop, they are pre-configured and available immediately after installation - "out of the box." In addition, the Polish language version of EuroLinux Desktop fills in the gaps in the Polish translations of the extensions and GNOME. 

## Appearance & Features
In EuroLinux Desktop, there is a translucent dock (taskbar) at the bottom of the screen. It stores icons for favorite applications, notifications and running programs, a button that displays icons for all applications in high magnification, as well as date and time information. It is possible to change the position of the bar to the right, left or top of the desktop, as well as to customize it extensively. The user can customize its height, length, transparency, color, icon spacing and size. The system allows icons to be placed on the desktop as standard, and provides a window maximization and minimization function.
EuroLinux Desktop disables the overview mode and the hotcorner function, which displays the preview mode when you hover the mouse over the top left corner of the screen. When you right-click on the wallpaper, additional menu items appear (including New Text Document). Notification icons from instant messaging or email programs have also been added. EuroLinux Desktop lets you switch day/night themes with a single click on the moon icon in the dock, and allows you to set a schedule for automatic theme switching based on the time of day.

## Multimedia
EuroLinux Desktop supports many media file formats (mp3, mpg, wma, ts, opus, ogg, mp4, flac, aiff, acc, ac3, avi), as well as the open codecs used for the popular mkv (Matroska) video files. Each of these formats can be run in the default Totem/Videos system player.

## Office Suite
EuroLinux Desktop includes the LibreOffice suite of office applications. It includes a word processor, spreadsheet, presentation editor, vector graphics editor, mathematical formula editor and relational database management system.

## Software
EuroLinux Desktop has been integrated with the Flathub repository, providing easy access to more than 2,000 free applications. They can be downloaded from the Software application and installed with a single click. The system also supports applications in AppImage format, the use of which is similar to programs with .exe or .msi extensions. However, in the case of EuroLinux Desktop, the AppImage application is always run from a non-privileged user. The system also allows the use of applications designed for Windows®, thanks to Steam®, Lutris or Wine.
