# EuroLinux 8.7 Beta Release Notes

EuroLinux 8.7 is the first beta release for x86_64 and aarch64 beta published
concurrently. The Beta version will allow us to provide EuroLinux 8.7 faster.

This versionâ€™s code name is Brussels - the capital city of Belgium and the
heart of European Union.


!!! info "Older modules removed" 
    In this beta we noticed that a lot of modules were obsoleted or removed, we
    are waiting for GA version to confirm that there will be a mechanism that
    should allow smoother migration between modules or that these modules will
    be available.

## Branded packages

Multiple packages have names changed due to branding, including:

- redhat-backgrounds -> el-backgrounds
- redhat-indexhtml -> el-indexhtml
- redhat-logos -> el-logos
- redhat-logos-httpd -> el-logos-httpd
- redhat-logos-ipa -> el-logos-ipa
- redhat-release -> el-release
- redhat-release-eula -> el-release - we include EULA in release package

All these packages have proper RPM `provides` declaration.

The list of the packages that are changed due to branding includes, among the
others:

- abrt
- anaconda
- anaconda-user-help
- cloud-init
- crash
- firefox
- httpd
- initial-setup
- ipa
- libguestfs
- libreoffice
- libreport
- nginx
- opa-ff
- opa-fm

## Removed packages

The following packages were removed:

- rhc and related packages
- insights-client and related packages

## Maven 3.8

**Maven 3.8** - module `maven` stream `3.8` was not introduced in this beta.
Currently upstream didn't provide modules metadata for
javapackages-tools:202201 and javapackages-bootstrap:202201 that are required to
build Maven 3.8. The default profile for javapackages-tools:202201 is available
in the Red Hat CodeReady-Builder repository but there is no modular metadata or
RPMs.

**We manage to create this module in not reproducible way** and in worst case
scenario we will provide specially crafted VM to build it for orgs that are
using Gaia Build System. We decided not to put this module as we are rebuilding
EuroLinux multiple times and not reproducible rebuilds are next to impossible to
maintain.


## Batteries

Batteries repository contains packages that are needed to rebuild the
distribution but are not included in any upstream repositories. Right now,
this repository includes more than 2500 packages for each buildroot.

About 30 packages were updated for x86_64 buildroot.

## Gaia build system

We are currently using Gaia 3.0 alpha.

## EuroLinux 9.1 beta

As we released a brand new EuroLinux Desktop we are working on better test
integrations with EuroLinux 9. This process takes time. We should deliver
EuroLinux 9.1 beta before EuroLinux 9.1 GA.
