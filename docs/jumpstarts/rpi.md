# EuroLinux for Raspberry Pi Jump Start

## About images

EuroLinux Raspberry are made for Raspberry Pi 4 model B. The system used is
EuroLinux 9. The minimal images could work with older version Raspberry Pi 3 as Raspberry Pi 3 does not meet minimum hardware requirements for the Enterprise
Linux 9.

The basic credentials are the following:

- `user`: root
- `password`: raspberry

**Note: That SSH root login is disabled by default on EuroLinux 9.**

The Raspberry Pi images also won't work with other ARM-64 computers as they are
specially tailored for this particular hardware.
